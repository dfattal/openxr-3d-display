# WebXR-in-Shell Plan

**Branch:** `feature/webxr-in-shell` (off `main` after `#161` is merged)
**Status:** All stages complete (0–4). Bridge-aware color shift in
shell (documented as a Stage 2 follow-up) resolved in commit
`48dbdc6b2` — see `webxr-bridge-color-shift-plan.md` §Outcome. Stage 4
(live resize during an active session) was implicitly satisfied by
the per-frame IPC pull added in Stage 2a — see Stage 4 entry below.
The qwerty-freeze stack from the Stage 4c agent prompt (commits
`0be7055f4` → `5ac8e5f2b`) landed before the color fix.

## Problem

When the shell is active and a user opens a Chrome WebXR page, the
Chrome-spawned OpenXR session connects to our service like any other IPC
client. The multi-compositor allocates a shell tile for it, so visually
*a window appears in the shell* with the page's content — that part
works automatically.

But the content inside the window is wrong:

1. Chrome allocates a headset-scale framebuffer (≈2160 px per eye,
   independent of any `recommendedImageRect` we hand it).
2. The shell tile is much smaller (e.g. 40 % of a 3840×2160 display =
   1536×2160 per view).
3. The compositor's shell-mode blit path **disables scaling**
   (`!sys->shell_mode` guard on `needs_scale` in
   `comp_d3d11_service.cpp`). So it copies the top-left
   `tile_w × tile_h` region of Chrome's framebuffer into the slot — a
   crop, not a resize. That's the "squished upper part" the user sees.
4. Even with scaling enabled, Chrome's view matrices would still be the
   ones it computed for a full-display-sized Kooima frustum: the
   perspective wouldn't match the window's size/position/distance.

The fix-by-scaling workaround would mask (3) but not (4), so the
geometry would still be wrong. We want the content to look correct:
**the app should render as if the shell window were the display**.

Two distinct codepaths are needed, matching our render-ready/raw split:

- **A. Legacy WebXR** (Chrome WebXR with no extension) — fix via
  `xrLocateViews` returning per-window Kooima matrices. The app
  renders "render-ready" per-view frustums just like any legacy handle
  app.

- **B. Bridge-aware WebXR** (pages using our `session.displayXR`
  extension) — scope `displayInfo` to the shell window. The app does
  its own Kooima math against a shell-window-sized "display". Same
  contract as our in-shell handle apps.

Both depend on the same piece of plumbing: **the per-client shell
window geometry must flow from `multi_comp` up to the state tracker
(for A) and to the bridge (for B)**.

## Today's state (as of this plan)

- `src/xrt/compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp`
  - `struct d3d11_multi_compositor` holds all per-slot geometry
    (`clients[i].window_rect`, window world pose, etc.).
  - `needs_scale` blit path is gated by `!sys->shell_mode`
    (~line 8861) — intentional per the atlas-stride invariant
    (see `feedback_atlas_stride_invariant.md` memory).
- `src/xrt/state_trackers/oxr/oxr_views.c` computes `xrLocateViews`
  from the device's view descriptors. No per-client override hook
  today.
- `src/xrt/targets/webxr_bridge/main.cpp`
  - Bridge forwards display-info from the physical display.
  - Has no concept of "the window the bridge session corresponds to".
  - Shell-mode display-info is passed through unchanged.
- `webxr-bridge/extension/src/main-world.js`
  - `session.displayXR.displayInfo` already fills from bridge
    messages; the sample's render loop re-reads
    `session.displayXR` each frame, so if the bridge pushes new
    info the sample adapts.
- `webxr-bridge/extension/src/isolated-world.js`
  - Connects lazily to bridge on first main-world message; no
    window-binding concept.

## Goal

1. **Legacy WebXR renders correctly inside a shell window**:
   perspective matches the window's size/position/distance, content
   fills the window at native resolution.
2. **Bridge-aware WebXR renders correctly inside a shell window**:
   same as a handle app — raw eye poses in window-local space, display
   info describes the window, live re-read picks up resize/pose
   changes.
3. **No regression** to bridge-aware WebXR on the full physical display
   (the non-shell case that works today).
4. **No regression** to in-process handle apps in the shell.
5. **Hide the bridge console window**: when the orchestrator's
   trampoline spawns `displayxr-webxr-bridge.exe`, a black console
   window currently pops up. The user shouldn't see it — the bridge
   runs headless-by-intent. Fix either by spawning with
   `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` / `DETACHED_PROCESS` in `launch_child_with_log`,
   or by flipping the bridge's linker subsystem to `WINDOWS` (it
   already redirects stdout to a log file, so losing the console is
   safe).
6. **Alt+Tab doesn't latch the right controller**: legacy WebXR uses
   the qwerty driver's Alt+drag to activate the right controller.
   When the user Alt+Tabs out of the compositor window, Windows
   swallows the Alt KEYUP (focus leaves before it arrives), so
   qwerty's "Alt held" state stays stuck and the right controller
   stays active on re-entry. Fix: on `WM_KILLFOCUS` /
   `WM_ACTIVATE(WA_INACTIVE)` in the compositor WndProc, clear any
   latched modifier state and release any active qwerty controllers.
   Also re-sync with `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_MENU)` on
   `WM_SETFOCUS` for safety.

## Design

### Shared plumbing: per-client window geometry

`multi_comp` already owns the slot rect + shell-window world pose for
each IPC client. Expose a small API:

```c
// Returns false if the client has no shell-window binding
// (e.g. shell_mode is off, or the client isn't registered yet).
bool
comp_d3d11_service_get_client_window_info(
    struct xrt_system_compositor *xsysc,
    uint32_t ipc_client_id,
    struct xrt_shell_window_info *out_info);

struct xrt_shell_window_info {
    uint32_t slot_w_px, slot_h_px;   // Tile size the client should render to
    struct xrt_pose  window_pose;    // Window plane pose in world (m)
    float            window_w_m;     // Window width in meters
    float            window_h_m;     // Window height in meters
    // ... whatever else matches Kooima inputs
};
```

Call sites:

- State tracker (oxr): for `xrLocateViews` override in shell mode.
- Bridge: when a WebXR session's IPC client shows up, bind it to the
  corresponding shell window.

Lookup key is the IPC client id (already available in both places).

### Path A: Legacy WebXR via `xrLocateViews`

In `oxr_views.c`, before returning the default per-view matrices:

```c
if (sys_is_shell_mode() && !is_bridge_aware(session)) {
    struct xrt_shell_window_info info;
    if (get_client_window_info(client_id, &info)) {
        compute_kooima_views(
            info.window_pose, info.window_w_m, info.window_h_m,
            user_eye_pose_left, user_eye_pose_right,
            &views[0], &views[1]);
        // Also clamp the returned per-view count to 2 for stereo
        // (WebXR is stereo only).
        return XR_SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

And in `xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews`, return a
`recommendedImageRect = slot_w/2 × slot_h` (per-view) so Chrome
allocates tile-sized buffers and we skip the blit-scale path
entirely.

**How to detect "bridge-aware vs legacy"**: bridge-aware sessions go
through our bridge host, which is a separate IPC client. Legacy
WebXR connects Chrome directly. Bind tracking: the bridge already
sets `DXR_BridgeClientActive` on the compositor HWND when a page
uses the extension. Extend that to a per-client flag the state
tracker can read.

**Gotcha:** the "user eye pose" must be the same pose that drives
shell raycasting (so what the user sees matches where they're
pointing). The shell already has this pose — plumb it through the
same accessor.

### Path B: Bridge-aware WebXR via scoped displayInfo

When a bridge session is associated with a shell window:

1. Bridge's `hello → display-info` handshake returns **window-scoped**
   info: `displayPixelSize = slot_w × slot_h`, `displayMeters =
   window_w_m × window_h_m`, eye poses in window-local space.
2. Shell, when the user drags/resizes a window, fires a new bridge
   message `window-info` (or reuses `display-info`) with updated
   dims/pose. The bridge pushes to the extension; `main-world.js`
   updates `latestDisplayInfo`; the sample's per-frame re-read of
   `session.displayXR` picks up the new `displayInfo` naturally.
3. When the user closes the window, shell tells the bridge to end the
   session (or the bridge detects the client disconnect).

**Per-session window binding**: today the bridge assumes one
compositor HWND. Add a map `{ ipc_client_id → shell_window_info }`
maintained by the service and queryable by the bridge over IPC.

### Path B add-ons: events

New bridge message types (both directions bridge↔extension):

- `window-info` (bridge → extension) — sent on session start and on
  resize/pose changes. Replaces/extends `display-info`.
- `shell-focus-changed` (bridge → extension) — optional, for
  letting pages react to focus lost/gained.

Isolated-world passes these to main-world unchanged. Main-world
treats `window-info` like a fresher `display-info`.

### Why this split

Keeping legacy and bridge-aware as two codepaths (not one unified
render-ready handoff) matches the current architecture's
render-ready-vs-raw split and avoids:

- Re-deriving legacy view matrices in bridge-aware sessions (would
  break our handle-app-compatible contract).
- Forcing legacy WebXR apps to adopt the bridge (they don't know
  about it).

## Staging

Each stage should build + test cleanly on its own.

### Stage 0 — shared plumbing
- Add `comp_d3d11_service_get_client_window_info` + the
  `xrt_shell_window_info` struct.
- No behavior change yet; just API wiring. Both legacy and
  bridge-aware still behave as today.
- Test: a debug log prints the window info for every new IPC client
  when shell is active.

### Stage 0a — hide bridge console window
- In `src/xrt/targets/service/service_orchestrator.c`
  `launch_child_with_log`, pass `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (or
  `DETACHED_PROCESS`) to `CreateProcessA` so the bridge's console
  doesn't flash onto the desktop. Stdout/stderr already go to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DisplayXR\webxr-bridge.log`, so no diagnostics are
  lost. Alternative: change the bridge target's linker
  `SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS` in its CMake target, which also hides the
  console at launch.
- Test: cold-start bridge (open bridge-aware page, click Enter VR);
  no black window appears. Log file still contains bridge output.
- Independent of the other stages — safe to ship first.

### Stage 0b — don't latch right controller across Alt+Tab
- In `src/xrt/compositor/d3d11/comp_d3d11_window.cpp` WndProc, add
  handlers for `WM_KILLFOCUS` and `WM_ACTIVATE` (WA_INACTIVE). On
  focus loss, clear any qwerty modifier state and release any
  active controllers (qwerty exposes reset hooks already used by
  the non-shell ESC close path — reuse if suitable).
- On `WM_SETFOCUS`, re-sync by calling `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_MENU)`
  / `VK_CONTROL` / `VK_SHIFT` and dropping any qwerty state whose
  key is no longer held.
- Root cause: when Alt+Tab fires, Windows delivers KEYDOWN(Alt) +
  KEYDOWN(Tab) but may swallow the matching KEYUPs once focus moves
  away — our qwerty "Alt held" flag then stays true.
- Test: launch legacy WebXR in shell (or standalone), Alt+drag to
  activate right controller (verify it moves), Alt+Tab to another
  app, Alt+Tab back. Right controller should be idle until the
  user Alt+drags again.
- Independent of the other stages — can ship alongside 0a.

### Stage 1 — scale-blit fallback (optional but recommended)
- Drop the `!sys->shell_mode` guard on `needs_scale`.
- Ensure the SRGB shader-blit path works in shell mode for the
  scaled case (re-read `feedback_srgb_blit_paths` memory before
  touching — current behavior is intentional for 1:1 copies).
- Test: Chrome WebXR content fills the window but perspective is
  still a headset-scale Kooima (wrong perspective, correct coverage).
- This gives us a non-broken-looking fallback while Stages 2/3 land.

### Stage 2 — Path A (legacy xrLocateViews override)
- In `oxr_views.c`, add the shell-mode override calling into the
  plumbing from Stage 0.
- In `oxr_instance.c` (or wherever view configs are enumerated),
  override `recommendedImageRect` for shell-mode clients.
- Test matrix:
  - Chrome WebXR sample page, shell active, one window → content
    fills window, perspective correct, responds to window drag
    *on next session* (live drag-during-session can be Stage 4).
  - Shell inactive, same page → no change (physical display
    Kooima, as today).
  - Two WebXR tabs → each gets its own window with its own matrices.

### Stage 3 — Path B (bridge-aware displayInfo scoping)
- In the bridge, associate each WS session with its IPC client id
  (already available from Chrome's OpenXR client handle).
- On `hello`, look up the shell window info and return window-scoped
  `display-info`.
- Test: bridge-aware sample in shell → renders with correct
  window-local Kooima, same as a handle app.

### Stage 4 — live resize/pose events ✅ (already covered by Stage 2a/3)

**Resolution:** No dedicated push-event work required. The per-frame
pull machinery added in Stage 2a (commit `d4001374a`) and the bridge's
own metric poll loop satisfy the live-resize requirement.

- **Legacy Chrome WebXR.** `xrLocateViews` invokes
  `oxr_session_get_window_metrics` per frame, which routes through
  `comp_ipc_client_compositor_get_window_metrics` → IPC →
  `comp_d3d11_service_get_client_window_metrics`. The server reads
  live `mc->clients[slot]` fields (no caching), so each frame's Kooima
  FOV reflects the current window pose/dimensions.
- **Bridge-aware sessions.** The bridge child polls
  `try_override_with_per_client_metrics` on its main loop (~60ms
  cadence in shell mode); when metrics change it pushes a fresh
  `window-info` JSON message over the WebSocket and Three.js reflows.
- **Drag/resize handling.** The multi-comp's title-drag and edge-resize
  handlers update `mc->clients[s].window_pose`, `window_width_m`,
  `window_height_m`, and recalculate `window_rect_*` on the same frame
  the input arrives. Both consumers above pick up the new values on
  the next frame.

The Stage 4 entry as originally written assumed a push model
(service-initiated `window-info` event). The pull model that Stage 2
shipped covers the same need at a lower cost (no push wiring, no
ordering hazards, latency bounded by frame rate / poll cadence).
Verified informally during the bridge color-shift regression sweep —
shrink-and-drag reflows the WebGL content immediately.

### Stage 5 — cleanup
- Remove Stage 1's scale-blit fallback if Stages 2/3 cover all
  real-world apps.
- Doc updates: `docs/architecture/extension-vs-legacy.md`,
  `docs/specs/XR_EXT_display_info.md`, any WebXR-specific docs.

## Test plan

Hardware: Leia SR display + dev machine (current setup).
Dependencies: working shell build, Chrome with WebXR enabled, local
static server for the bridge-aware sample.

| Stage | Test |
|-------|------|
| 0 | Build only. Log per-client window info on client connect. |
| 0a | Cold-start a bridge-aware page. No console window flashes. Log still written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DisplayXR\webxr-bridge.log`. |
| 0b | Legacy WebXR running. Alt+drag → right controller active. Alt+Tab away, Alt+Tab back. Right controller idle until user Alt+drags again. |
| 1 | Open `immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/immersive-vr-session.html` in Chrome while shell active. Content fills the window (but perspective looks off). |
| 2 | Same test → perspective is correct for the window's size/distance. Drag the window, exit and re-enter VR → new session uses the new window geometry. |
| 3 | Open `http://localhost:8000/sample/` (our bridge sample) in Chrome while shell active. Content renders with window-local Kooima — visually equivalent to a handle cube app in the same slot. |
| 4 | While the sample is live, drag the shell window. The cube's perspective smoothly tracks the new geometry. |
| 5 | Regression sweep: cube_handle_d3d11 in shell still works; legacy WebXR with shell off still works; bridge-aware WebXR with shell off still works (full-display Kooima). |

## Gotchas / known risks

- **Head-pose consistency**: Chrome's WebXR uses a stationary-type
  reference space by default. The "user eye pose" we inject must be
  stable in the same space; otherwise content jitters. Likely we want
  to use the shell's already-computed user pose and accept that
  WebXR's `XRFrame.getViewerPose` will track shell head-pose, not a
  controller.
- **Two compositor swapchains**: remember the canvas-vs-display split
  (see `docs/specs/swapchain-model.md`). `recommendedImageRect` must
  match canvas dims, not display dims, or legacy apps render into
  mis-sized buffers.
- **Atlas stride invariant**: tiles always at `sys->view_width` stride
  in shell mode. Don't break that when plumbing new slot sizes (see
  `feedback_atlas_stride_invariant.md`).
- **Bridge session lifecycle**: today the bridge assumes one session.
  Multiple WebXR windows = multiple bridge sessions. The existing
  singleton-ish state needs a per-session index before Stage 3.
- **SRGB in scale path**: see `feedback_srgb_blit_paths.md` — non-shell
  scaling uses a shader that linearizes; 1:1 shell copies don't. If
  Stage 1 ships, make sure the shader path runs for shell-mode scale
  too.
- **Chrome's own scaling**: Chrome may apply DPR / foveation that
  surprises the `recommendedImageRect` override. Log the fb size it
  actually allocates and iterate from there.

- Passthrough or video layers from WebXR.
- Per-window eye tracking (shell provides one user pose driving all
  windows — accept that).
- Android / macOS.
- Audio spatialization per-window.
