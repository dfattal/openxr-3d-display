# Swapchain Model

Each compositor maintains two distinct, unrelated swapchains. Understanding this separation is essential for compositor and display processor development.

## Two Swapchains

### App Swapchain

- **Allocated by**: the runtime via `xrCreateSwapchain`
- **Sized to**: worst-case atlas dimensions across all rendering modes (allocated once at session creation)
- **Content**: the app renders a tiled atlas of views into this swapchain
- **Flow direction**: app → compositor (input)

### Target Swapchain

- **Allocated by**: the compositor
- **Sized to**: the output window dimensions
- **Content**: the display processor writes interlaced/weaved output here
- **Flow direction**: compositor → display (output)

These two swapchains are unrelated — the app swapchain flows in, the target swapchain flows out.

## Pipeline

```
App Swapchain          Compositor              Display Processor        Target Swapchain
(worst-case atlas) --> crop to content dims --> process_atlas()      --> (window-sized)
                                                (interlace/weave)        --> present
```

1. **App** renders tiled views into the app swapchain (atlas layout from active rendering mode)
2. **Compositor** crops the atlas to the active mode's content dimensions (the atlas may be smaller than the worst-case allocation)
3. **Display processor** receives the cropped atlas + tile layout (`tile_columns`, `tile_rows`), extracts views, and produces the final interlaced/weaved output into the target swapchain
4. **Compositor** presents the target swapchain to the display

See [Multiview Tiling — Compositor-Side Contract](multiview-tiling.md) for the full crop-blit algorithm.

## Canvas Concept

The **canvas** is the sub-rect of the window where 3D content appears. For `_handle` and `_hosted` apps, the canvas equals the window. For `_texture` apps, the canvas may be smaller than the display — the app dedicates only part of its window to 3D content.

View dimensions and Kooima projection must be based on **canvas** size, not display size. This is critical for `_texture` apps.

The canvas rect is set via `xrSetSharedTextureOutputRectEXT` — see the [window binding spec](XR_EXT_win32_window_binding.md#35-xrsetsharedtextureoutputrectext) for the full API reference. The compositor plumbs this rect through to the display processor's `process_atlas()` call as `canvas_offset_x/y` and `canvas_width/height`, enabling correct phase alignment for lenticular interlacing. The app's real window handle (HWND / NSView) is passed directly to the display processor — no hidden windows are involved.

See [Multiview Tiling — Terminology: Display, Window, Canvas](multiview-tiling.md) for formal definitions.
