 * These tools back Phase B of the MCP v0.2 spec: list_windows,
 * get/set_window_pose, set_focus, apply_layout_preset, save/load_workspace.
 * They run on the MCP server thread started by u_mcp_server_maybe_start_named()
 * and read/write workspace state via the same IPC paths the workspace controller uses.

 * Register the Phase B workspace tools against the global MCP server.
 *
 * Must be called after @c u_mcp_server_maybe_start_named("service") so the
 * server-thread picks the tools up via the shared registry. Stashes @p s
 * in a file-static global so tool handlers can look up per-client state
 * without routing through a userdata ABI change.
 *
 * Safe to call when MCP is disabled — the registry is harmless when the
 * server thread was never spawned.
