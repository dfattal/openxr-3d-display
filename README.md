# DisplayXR Runtime

An open-source [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) runtime for glasses-free 3D displays — autostereoscopic monitors and laptops that deliver head-tracked stereoscopic 3D without worn hardware.

Built on [Monado](https://monado.freedesktop.org/) by Collabora, DisplayXR strips away headset-centric infrastructure (34 VR drivers, Vulkan server compositor, tracking subsystems) and replaces it with a lightweight runtime purpose-built for 3D displays: ~150 files, 3 drivers, native compositors for every graphics API.

## Design Principles

### Native compositors — no Vulkan intermediary

Every graphics API gets its own compositor that talks directly to the display pipeline. D3D11 apps render through a D3D11 compositor; Metal apps through Metal; and so on. No format conversion, no interop overhead, no GPU compatibility surprises.

### Lightweight and focused

Only what 3D displays need: 3 drivers (leia, sim_display, qwerty), native compositors, and the OpenXR state tracker. Every file in the tree is relevant.

### Four app classes

| Class | Suffix | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Window-handle** | `_ext` | App provides its own window via `XR_EXT_*_window_binding`. Runtime composites into it. |
| **Shared-texture** | `_shared` | App provides textures. Runtime composites into its own window. |
| **Runtime-managed** | `_rt` | Runtime creates the window and rendering targets (standard OpenXR/WebXR path). |
| **IPC/Service** | `_ipc` | App runs out-of-process via client compositor → IPC → server multi-compositor. Foundation for multi-app spatial shell. |

Test app naming follows the pattern `cube_{class}_{api}_{platform}`: `cube_ext_metal_macos`, `cube_shared_gl_macos`, `cube_rt_vk_macos` (runtime-managed), `cube_ipc_d3d11` (service mode).

## Compositor Status

| API | Windows | macOS |
|-----|---------|-------|
| D3D11 | Shipping | — |
| D3D12 | Shipping | — |
| Metal | — | Shipping |
| OpenGL | Shipping | Shipping |
| Vulkan | Shipping | Shipping |

## OpenXR Extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `XR_EXT_win32_window_binding` | App provides its own Win32 HWND for OpenXR rendering (windowed mode, multi-app) |
| `XR_EXT_cocoa_window_binding` | App provides a Cocoa NSView for rendering (macOS) |
| `XR_EXT_android_surface_binding` | App provides an Android Surface for rendering |
| `XR_EXT_display_info` | Exposes physical display geometry, canonical viewing pyramid, nominal viewer position, and recommended render resolution scaling |

See the [full extension proposal](doc/extensions/XR_EXT_tracked_3d_display_proposal.md) for the formal specification.

## Quick Start

### Windows (Primary Platform)

Requires Visual Studio 2022, CMake, Ninja, and a vendor SDK (e.g., [Leia SR SDK](https://www.leiainc.com/)).

```bash
# Set SDK path
set LEIASR_SDKROOT=C:\path\to\SimulatedReality

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%LEIASR_SDKROOT%
cmake --build .
```

### macOS

macOS builds use the sim_display driver as a vendor-neutral test target. No vendor hardware required.

```bash
# Prerequisites
brew install cmake ninja eigen vulkan-sdk

# Build
./scripts/build_macos.sh
```

### Running Without Installing

```bash
XR_RUNTIME_JSON=./build/openxr_displayxr-dev.json ./your_openxr_app
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full build details, CMake options, and CI configuration.

## Simulation Driver

You don't need a 3D display to develop against this runtime. The **sim_display** driver provides a simulated tracked 3D display with keyboard-controlled eye position, letting you test the full OpenXR pipeline on any machine:

```bash
# After building, run the test cube app
XR_RUNTIME_JSON=./build/openxr_displayxr-dev.json ./build/test_apps/cube_rt_vk_macos/cube_rt_vk_macos
```

Use WASD + mouse to move the simulated eye position and observe perspective-correct stereo rendering.

## Architecture

## Future Direction

- **Multi-compositor spatial shell** — platform-native window manager for 3D displays ([#43](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/43), [#44](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/44))
- **Display extensions** — rendering mode enumeration ([#8](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/8)), multiview support ([#5](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/5)), display mode events ([#3](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/3))
- **Interface standardization** — unified display processor interface ([#45](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/45)), display spatial model ([#46](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/issues/46))

See the [milestone tracker](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display/milestones) for the full roadmap.

## Unity Plugin

The **DisplayXR** Unity plugin lives in a separate repository:
[**dfattal/unity-3d-display**](https://github.com/dfattal/unity-3d-display)

Install via Unity Package Manager with the git URL:
```
https://github.com/dfattal/unity-3d-display.git
```

The plugin intercepts Unity's OpenXR pipeline to provide Kooima asymmetric frustum projection for stereo rendering on 3D displays. It has no source dependency on this runtime — install the runtime separately and point `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` to it.
