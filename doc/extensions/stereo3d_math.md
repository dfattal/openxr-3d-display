# Stereo 3D Math: Display-Centric and Camera-Centric Pipelines

This document describes the two stereo projection pipelines used throughout
the project for 3D (light field) displays with eye tracking.  Both pipelines
take the same raw eye-tracking inputs and share a common first stage, then
diverge in how they build the view and projection matrices.

## Inputs (common to both pipelines)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `raw_left` | `XrVector3f` | Raw left-eye position in **display space** (from eye tracker via `xrLocateViews`) |
| `raw_right` | `XrVector3f` | Raw right-eye position in **display space** |
| `nominal_viewer` | `XrVector3f*` | Default viewer position in display space; NULL defaults to `{0, 0, 0.5}` (50 cm from screen center) |
| `screen` | width/height in meters | Physical screen dimensions |
| `near_z`, `far_z` | `float` | Near and far clip plane distances |

**Display space** is defined with the origin at the center of the physical
screen, +X right, +Y up, +Z pointing out of the screen toward the viewer.
Eye positions are in meters.

## Common Stage: Eye Factor Processing (Step 1)

Both pipelines begin with `display3d_apply_eye_factors()`.  This function
takes the raw eye positions and produces processed positions by applying two
successive factors:

### Step 1a — IPD Factor (`ipd_factor`, range [0, 1])

Scales the inter-eye vector around the midpoint of the two eyes.

```
center   = (raw_left + raw_right) / 2
left_vec = (raw_left  - center) * ipd_factor
right_vec = (raw_right - center) * ipd_factor
```

- `ipd_factor = 1.0` preserves the physical IPD.
- `ipd_factor = 0.0` collapses both eyes to the midpoint (mono).

The midpoint itself is unchanged — only the separation changes.

### Step 1b — Parallax Factor (`parallax_factor`, range [0, 1])

Lerps the eye-pair center toward the nominal viewer position.  Only the Z
component lerps toward `nominal_viewer.z`; X and Y lerp toward zero (the
display-center axis).

```
center'.x = parallax_factor * center.x
center'.y = parallax_factor * center.y
center'.z = nominal_z + parallax_factor * (center.z - nominal_z)

processed_left  = center' + left_vec
processed_right = center' + right_vec
```

- `parallax_factor = 1.0` keeps the tracked position as-is.
- `parallax_factor = 0.0` locks the viewpoint on the display-center axis at
  the nominal distance (no head-tracking parallax, stereo from IPD only).

After this stage, `processed_left` and `processed_right` are ready for the
pipeline-specific steps below.

## Display-Centric Pipeline

**Concept**: the physical display is a window into the virtual world.  The
screen edges define the frustum boundaries; the eye's position relative to
those edges determines the asymmetric projection.  Think *"looking through a
window."*

### Tunables (`Display3DTunables`)

| Field | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `ipd_factor` | [0, 1] | See common stage |
| `parallax_factor` | [0, 1] | See common stage |
| `perspective_factor` | [0.1, 10] | Scales eye XYZ in display space (changes perspective strength) |
| `virtual_display_height` | > 0 | Virtual display height in app units; determines the meters-to-virtual ratio (`m2v`) |

### Pipeline

**Step 1** — Apply IPD and parallax factors (common stage above).

**Step 2** — Compute the meters-to-virtual conversion factor:

```
m2v = virtual_display_height / screen.height_m
```

This maps physical meters into the app's coordinate system.  If
`virtual_display_height` equals `screen.height_m`, the ratio is 1:1 (one
app unit = one meter).

**Step 3** — Scale eye position into virtual units:

```
eye_scaled = processed * perspective_factor * m2v
```

All three components (x, y, z) are scaled uniformly.  `perspective_factor`
lets the app exaggerate or dampen the perspective effect independently of
the virtual display size.

**Step 4** — Scale screen dimensions into virtual units:

```
kScreenW = screen.width_m  * m2v
kScreenH = screen.height_m * m2v
```

**Step 5** — Transform `eye_scaled` from display space to world space:

```
eye_world = quat_rotate(display_orientation, eye_scaled) + display_position
```

If no `display_pose` is provided, this is an identity transform.

**Step 6** — Build the view matrix:

```
viewMatrix = transpose(R) * translate(-eye_world)
```

where `R` is the rotation matrix from `display_pose.orientation`.  This is
the standard "inverse camera transform" — rotate into display frame, then
translate to the eye.

**Step 7** — Build the Kooima projection matrix.  Given `eye_scaled = (ex, ey, ez)`
and scaled screen half-dimensions `halfW`, `halfH`:

```
halfW = kScreenW / 2
halfH = kScreenH / 2

left   = near_z * (-halfW - ex) / ez
right  = near_z * ( halfW - ex) / ez
bottom = near_z * (-halfH - ey) / ez
top    = near_z * ( halfH - ey) / ez
```

These are the classic Kooima similar-triangle ratios: each screen edge is
projected through the eye onto the near plane.  The resulting asymmetric
frustum is assembled into a standard OpenGL-style column-major projection
matrix.

If `ez <= 0.001`, it falls back to 0.65 m (arm's length) to avoid
division by zero.

**Step 8** — Compute FOV angles from the same geometry:

```
fov.angleLeft  = atan((-halfW - ex) / ez)
fov.angleRight = atan(( halfW - ex) / ez)
fov.angleUp    = atan(( halfH - ey) / ez)
fov.angleDown  = atan((-halfH - ey) / ez)
```

### Outputs (`Display3DStereoView` per eye)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `view_matrix[16]` | Column-major 4x4 view matrix |
| `projection_matrix[16]` | Column-major 4x4 asymmetric Kooima projection |
| `fov` | `XrFovf` — four signed angles in radians |
| `eye_display` | Processed eye position in display space (after all factors and scaling) |
| `eye_world` | Eye position in world space |
| `orientation` | Display orientation (same for both eyes) |

## Camera-Centric Pipeline

**Concept**: the app defines a virtual camera (position, orientation, base
vFOV).  Eye tracking data produces asymmetric perturbations to the camera's
frustum.  The physical screen dimensions contribute only the aspect ratio.
Think *"a virtual camera whose frustum shifts with your head."*

### Tunables (`Camera3DTunables`)

| Field | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `ipd_factor` | [0, 1] | See common stage |
| `parallax_factor` | [0, 1] | See common stage |
| `inv_convergence_distance` | > 0 | `1 / convergence_distance` in 1/meters.  Controls how much eye displacement shifts the frustum.  Larger values = stronger stereo in projection. |
| `half_tan_vfov` | > 0 | `tan(vFOV / 2)`.  Defines the base symmetric FOV before asymmetric shifts.  Divide by a zoom factor at the call site for easy zooming (no trig round-trip). |

### Pipeline

**Step 1** — Apply IPD and parallax factors (common stage above, reuses
`display3d_apply_eye_factors()`).

**Step 2** — Compute the eye displacement from the nominal screen plane:

```
eye_local.x = processed.x
eye_local.y = processed.y
eye_local.z = processed.z - nominal_z
```

This gives the eye's offset relative to the screen surface.  A viewer
sitting at exactly the nominal distance has `eye_local.z = 0`.

**Step 3** — Transform `eye_local` from display space to world space via the
camera pose:

```
eye_world = quat_rotate(camera_orientation, eye_local) + camera_position
```

**Step 4** — Build the view matrix (same formula as display-centric):

```
viewMatrix = transpose(R) * translate(-eye_world)
```

where `R` is the rotation matrix from `camera_pose.orientation`.

**Step 5** — Scale `eye_local` by `inv_convergence_distance` for the
projection shift:

```
dx = eye_local.x * inv_convergence_distance
dy = eye_local.y * inv_convergence_distance
dz = eye_local.z * inv_convergence_distance
```

This controls how strongly the eye displacement affects the frustum
asymmetry.  A larger convergence distance (smaller `invd`) means the
frustum shifts less per unit of eye movement.

**Step 6** — Compute the base symmetric half-tangents:

```
ro = half_tan_vfov * aspect    (horizontal half-tangent)
uo = half_tan_vfov             (vertical half-tangent)

where aspect = screen.width_m / screen.height_m
```

**Step 7** — Compute asymmetric tangent half-angles by shifting the base
FOV with the scaled eye displacement:

```
denom     = 1 + dz

tan_right = (ro - dx) / denom
tan_left  = (ro + dx) / denom
tan_up    = (uo - dy) / denom
tan_down  = (uo + dy) / denom
```

When `dx = dy = dz = 0` (no eye displacement), this reduces to the
symmetric frustum `[-ro, +ro] x [-uo, +uo]`.  Non-zero displacements
shift and scale the frustum asymmetrically.

**Step 8** — Build the projection matrix from the tangent half-angles:

```
left   = -tan_left  * near_z
right  =  tan_right * near_z
bottom = -tan_down  * near_z
top    =  tan_up    * near_z
```

Then assemble the standard asymmetric frustum projection matrix.

**Step 9** — Convert tangents to `XrFovf` angles (OpenXR signed convention):

```
fov.angleLeft  = -atan(tan_left)
fov.angleRight =  atan(tan_right)
fov.angleUp    =  atan(tan_up)
fov.angleDown  = -atan(tan_down)
```

### Outputs (`Camera3DStereoView` per eye)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `view_matrix[16]` | Column-major 4x4 view matrix |
| `projection_matrix[16]` | Column-major 4x4 asymmetric frustum projection |
| `fov` | `XrFovf` — four signed angles in radians |
| `eye_world` | Eye position in world space |
| `orientation` | Camera orientation (same for both eyes) |

No `eye_display` — the display-space eye position is not meaningful in
camera-centric mode since the projection is derived from the camera's
base FOV, not from screen geometry.

## When to Use Which

| Use case | Pipeline | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| AR / passthrough / "window into world" | Display-centric | The physical screen *is* the viewing window; its geometry must drive the frustum |
| 3D game with free camera | Camera-centric | The app controls the camera; eye tracking perturbs the frustum for stereo |
| Fixed viewpoint with known display | Display-centric | Direct physical correspondence between screen and frustum |
| Zoom / vFOV control needed | Camera-centric | `half_tan_vfov / zoom` is trivial; display-centric has no FOV knob |
| 1:1 physical scale required | Display-centric | Set `virtual_display_height = screen.height_m` for metric fidelity |

---

## Matrix Convention

All output matrices are **column-major** (OpenGL / Vulkan / Metal order).
DirectX callers using row-major `XMMATRIX` should transpose on load.
